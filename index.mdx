**ShipsecAI Studio** is a modern, open source automation platform built for security and IT engineers. Shipsec  comes with a no-code / low-code UI for workflows, out-of-the-box integrations, lookup tables, and case management. Workflows are orchestrated using [**Temporal**](https://temporal.io/) for scale and reliability.

## Tutorials

<Info>
  You can sync custom YAML integrations and Python scripts directly into ShipsecAI Studio from a private Git repo. Learn more in the [**custom integrations**](https://docs.shipsecai.com/tutorials/custom-integrations) tutorial. This is the recommended way to use ShipsecAI. All reusable integrations should be stored and version controlled in your own GitHub / GitLab repository.
