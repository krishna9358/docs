Components are the building blocks of ShipSec Studio workflows. Each component performs a specific task and can be connected together to create powerful automation pipelines.

## How Components Work

Each component has:

- **Inputs** – Data ports that accept connections from other components
- **Outputs** – Data ports that can be connected to downstream components  
- **Parameters** – Configurable settings in the sidebar

Components run inside Docker containers for isolation and reliability. Workflows are orchestrated by [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) with automatic retries and resumability.

## Example Pipeline

A typical security reconnaissance workflow:

```
Manual Trigger → Subfinder → DNSX → httpx → Webhook
```

1. **Manual Trigger** – User provides target domains
2. **Subfinder** – Discovers subdomains
3. **DNSX** – Resolves DNS records
4. **httpx** – Probes for live HTTP services
5. **Webhook** – Sends results to Slack/Teams
